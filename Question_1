What is software engineering?
  - Software engineering is a disciplined and systematic approach to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software. It involves the application of engineering principles to software creation to ensure that it is reliable, efficient, and meets user requirements. Software engineering encompasses a wide range of tasks and methodologies aimed at producing high-quality software that is maintainable and scalable over its lifecycle.

how does it differ from traditional programming?
  - Traditional Programming: Focuses primarily on writing code to solve specific problems or perform particular tasks. The emphasis is on the coding phase, with less attention given to other aspects like planning, design, and maintenance.
  - Software Engineering: Involves a broader scope that includes not just coding, but also requirements gathering, system design, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It addresses the entire lifecycle of the software product.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?
  - The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that defines the process used by software engineers to develop, maintain, and replace software.
